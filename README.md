# [Create a REST API With Lumen][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Lumen is Laravel's little brother: a fast, lightweight micro-framework for writing RESTful APIs. With just a little bit of code, you can use Lumen to build a secure and extremely fast RESTful API.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how to get started building REST APIs with the Lumen framework. You'll start by setting up a Lumen development environment and go on to building a complete API for a music store, including routing, MySQL database connectivity, and security.
